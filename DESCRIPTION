Description: The VET is a memory test in which a study list of 6 images is shown
    followed by a series of test trials. A test trial is composed of one target 
    image and two distractor images. As input, this package takes a distance matrix where each
    row and column describe the distance between two images on the VET. Row and column
    names correspond to the names of the images in the VET. For example, the cell corresponding to 
    the row named 'bird_1.bmp' and the column 'bird_2.bmp' corresponds to the distance between those
    two images. In addition to a distance matrix, the package also requires a function that
    outputs a probability of correctly choosing a target image given the similarities on each test trial.
